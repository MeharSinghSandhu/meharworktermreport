In this website, I will reflect on my learning experiences, the challenges I faced, and the creative solutions we developed to support the students’ learning experience.</p>

In the first-year curriculum, students work on design challenges that combine mechanical and computing skills, like the “Teddy Bear Wheelchair” project. The department encourages practical learning, and we worked in the design lab in the Thornbrough building, where we brainstormed, designed, and tested our projects.</p>

               <br> Measure of Success: I observed positive feedback from the professor and teammates, especially regarding clearer communication and a more collaborative team dynamic.
               <br> <br>Learning Goal 2: Creative Thinking<br>Action Plan: I engaged in brainstorming sessions, researched design concepts, and worked on prototype testing.
                <br>Measure of Success: I successfully contributed creative solutions during the design of the wheelchair project, which received positive feedback from the team.

            <br><br>Q- What skills did you want to learn? How will these tasks benefit your next work experience?<br>

            I wanted to learn more about working with hardware, like Arduinos, motors, sensors, and 3D printers, since that was new to me as a Computer Science student. These skills will help me in the future by giving me hands-on experience with projects that combine software and physical devices, and making me more confident in teams. Overall, it’s made me more prepared for different types of projects.</p>

                Q- What technologies did you want to work with and why?<br><br>
                I wanted to work with hardware technologies like Arduinos, motors, sensors, and 3D printers because they were new to me as a Computer Science student. Working with 3D printers taught me how to use SolidWorks and operate the machines, while I also learned to code sensors using Arduinos. These were very useful technologies, giving me hands-on experience in combining software with physical devices. I wanted to explore these tools to make myself more versatile and better prepared for future engineering and tech projects.

Did you learn them in class or on the job? <br><br>We worked on various tasks, including managing lab inventory, ordering new parts, and learning how to utilize AI for reflections and projects. This involved controlling AI tools, brainstorming ideas, documenting them, and rating each idea using a weighted criteria system to prioritize important aspects and identify the best solutions. This approach fostered creativity and helped us design an effective project rubric. Our final project, the "Teddy Bear Wheelchair," featured a car with a teddy bear on top that could climb an incline with weights attached to its back and launch garbage into a bin.</p>
                    <br><br>I would like to acknowledge Prof. Stephen Mattucci for his invaluable guidance and support throughout this project.
